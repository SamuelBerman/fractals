# fractals
A collection of fractal generating algorithms written in Python by Samuel Berman

This was a project undertaken for fun and educational purposes, so the code is not well optimized. Versions of these algorithms were implemented in Java, Go, and OpenGL shaders, but they are not included in this repository.

Examples of each type of fractal can be found in the *fractal_images* folder. Download the code and modify the parameters to create your own!![roots 3840x2160 2020-10-04 13-29-14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11687897/212463361-887a9c6b-8a52-45ba-bab1-9a38d8b3d677.png)
